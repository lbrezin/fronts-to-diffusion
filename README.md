# Simulation code and analysis for the paper "Transition from traveling fronts to diffusion-limited growth in expanding populations".

The paper simulates and analyses the results of the coupled PDEs given by Eq. (4) of the main text. 

- NLDv3.py and NLD2d.py contain the classes and functions for simulating the PDEs in one and two dimensions respectively
- analysis.ipynb is a notebook that contains all the analysis and the code to produce the figures of the paper
- run_simulation.py is an example of a script to run and save the simulation in an HDF5 file, with a csv file that stores the simulation parameters
